# Amazon FBA Sourcing System

> **Step 3 update (2026-04-28):** Repo restructured. One engine, named
> strategies, ordered steps. The two former pipelines (`keepa_niche_finder/`,
> `supplier_pricelist_finder/`) no longer exist as separate top-level trees.
> See `docs/architecture.md`.

## Current State
**Last updated:** 2026-04-28
**Currently working on:** Reorganisation steps 1-3 complete (config centralisation, engine deduplication, repo restructuring). Next: step 4 (extract steps catalogue from legacy Keepa pipeline).
**Next steps:** Step 4 — port Keepa phases to Python, integrate with shared engine. Then step 5 (strategies as YAML) and step 6 (Skill 99 / new strategies).
**Blockers:** SP-API credentials still awaited; doesn't block reorganisation but blocks `services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/` from being usable.

## Session Protocol
- At the end of each session, update the "Current State" section above
- If you learned something about how this project works that would help next time, add it to this file
- Commit CLAUDE.md changes as part of your work

## Read these first

For any work in this repo, read in this order:

1. **`docs/SPEC.md`** — business logic, decision rules, the truth (supersedes the v5 PRD)
2. **`docs/architecture.md`** — how the system is laid out
3. **`AGENTS.md`** — agent behaviour rules, what not to do

For specific work:

- **Strategy work** → `docs/strategies/<strategy>.md` for that strategy
- **Adapter work** (adding/fixing a supplier) → `fba_engine/adapters/<supplier>/` and look at sibling adapters as templates
- **Threshold tuning** → `shared/config/decision_thresholds.yaml` (the single tunable knob is `target_roi`)

## Common operations

### Run the supplier pricelist strategy
```bash
python run.py --supplier connect-beauty
# or with explicit market data
python run.py --supplier abgee --market-data fba_engine/data/pricelists/abgee/raw/keepa_combined.csv
```

### Run all tests
```bash
# Shared library + canonical engine
cd shared/lib/python && pytest tests/ sourcing_engine/tests/ && cd ../../..

# Per-supplier adapter tests (run from supplier folder so relative paths resolve)
for s in abgee connect-beauty shure zappies; do
  cd fba_engine/data/pricelists/$s && pytest ../../../adapters/$s/tests/ && cd ../../../..
done
```

Note: the supplier adapter tests use relative paths like `raw/some_file.pdf`,
so they must be invoked from the supplier's data folder.

### Add a new supplier
1. Create `fba_engine/adapters/<new-supplier>/` (use `_template/` as starting point)
2. Implement `ingest.py` and `normalise.py` for that supplier's file format
3. Create `fba_engine/data/pricelists/<new-supplier>/raw/` and drop in price lists
4. Run `python run.py --supplier <new-supplier>`

### Tune the ROI target
Edit `shared/config/decision_thresholds.yaml`:
```yaml
target_roi: 0.30   # change to taste
```
That's it. All downstream gates derive from this.

## What changed in steps 1-3 (recap)

- **Step 1:** Centralised all thresholds into `shared/config/`. Replaced the
  margin-based SHORTLIST gate with an ROI-based gate (single tunable: `target_roi`).
  Doc drift fixed.

- **Step 2:** Deduplicated the sourcing engine — was 4× copied across
  supplier folders, now one canonical copy at `shared/lib/python/sourcing_engine/`.
  Per-supplier code reduced to just the legitimately-different
  `ingest.py` and `normalise.py` files.

- **Step 3:** Restructured the repo. The two old top-level pipelines
  (`keepa_niche_finder/`, `supplier_pricelist_finder/`) no longer exist as
  separate trees. Engine code is in `shared/`, supplier adapters and data
  are in `fba_engine/`, MCP is in `services/`. Vestigial files removed.
  v5 PRD/BUILD_PROMPT moved to `docs/archive/`.

---

## What's coming in steps 4-6

- **Step 4:** Extract the legacy Keepa phases (currently in `fba_engine/_legacy_keepa/`)
  into composable steps at `fba_engine/steps/` (Python translation of the
  Node.js implementation). After step 4, `_legacy_keepa/` is gone.

- **Step 5:** Express both existing strategies as YAML compositions in
  `fba_engine/strategies/`. A `runner.py` reads a strategy YAML and executes
  its steps. Cowork orchestrates this.

- **Step 6:** Implement Skill 99 (Find Suppliers For Keepa-Discovered ASINs)
  as a new strategy composing existing steps + one new discovery step.
  Future strategies (brand outreach, retail arbitrage) follow the same pattern.
