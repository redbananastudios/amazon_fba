# Amazon FBA Sourcing System

> **Step 3 update (2026-04-28):** Repo restructured. One engine, named
> strategies, ordered steps. The two former pipelines (`keepa_niche_finder/`,
> `supplier_pricelist_finder/`) no longer exist as separate top-level trees.
> See `docs/architecture.md`.

## Current State
**Last updated:** 2026-04-28 (end of session)
**Currently working on:** MCP sourcing-tools expansion — adding 7 new tools to `services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/` (ungating, FBA eligibility, batch fees, catalog, live pricing, composite preflight + persistent cache). Branch: `feat/mcp-sourcing-tools` ([PR draft URL](https://github.com/redbananastudios/amazon_fba/pull/new/feat/mcp-sourcing-tools)).
**Status:** Reorganisation steps 1-3 ✅ merged into main. SP-API credentials acquired and verified live (`getMarketplaceParticipations` works). Scaffold for sourcing-tools committed (`15f6311`): SPEC.md, DiskCache, types, .gitignore. **Note:** UK marketplace shows `hasSuspendedListings: true` — check Account Health when convenient (informational only, not blocking).
**Next steps:** Pick up `feat/mcp-sourcing-tools` branch in a fresh session. Read `services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/SPEC.md` for full design, then implement Tier 1 (3 tools), Tier 2 (2 tools), Tier 3 (composite + CLI), pipeline integration, real-API integration tests, PR. ~5h focused implementation work remaining. **Decision-gate is NOT changed**: ungating data is informational only — surfaces in output, never auto-rejects.
**Blockers:** None. All credentials in place, scaffold tested (25 vitest tests passing).

### To resume next session
1. `cd O:/fba/.claude/worktrees/upbeat-brattain-8a0646` (or recreate the worktree off `feat/mcp-sourcing-tools`)
2. Read `services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/SPEC.md` (the source of truth for this feature)
3. Read this section + `git log feat/mcp-sourcing-tools` to see what's committed
4. Continue with Tier 1: implement `check_listing_restrictions`, `check_fba_eligibility`, `estimate_fees_batch` in that order

### Workflow notes (learned this session)
- **Worktree gotcha:** `[[ -d .git ]]` checks fail in worktrees because `.git` is a file pointer. Use `[[ -e .git ]]`.
- **TS imports:** This project uses ESM/nodenext — relative imports MUST end in `.js` even when source is `.ts` (e.g., `import {X} from "./foo.js"`). Otherwise `npm run build` fails (vitest is more lenient).
- **MCP test path:** Always run `npm` commands inside the actual worktree's `services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/`, not `O:/fba/services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/`. They're separate copies.
- **Credential sync:** After editing `F:\My Drive\workspace\credentials.env`, run `& 'F:\My Drive\workspace\sync-credentials.ps1'` (PowerShell — bash quoting breaks on the space in "My Drive"). Then verify with `grep '"SP_API_' "C:/Users/peter/.claude/settings.json"`.
- **MCP `.mcp.json` path** at repo root references the MCP at `services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/dist/index.js` (corrected from old root-level path during cleanup).

## Session Protocol
- At the end of each session, update the "Current State" section above
- If you learned something about how this project works that would help next time, add it to this file
- Commit CLAUDE.md changes as part of your work

## Read these first

For any work in this repo, read in this order:

1. **`docs/SPEC.md`** — business logic, decision rules, the truth (supersedes the v5 PRD)
2. **`docs/architecture.md`** — how the system is laid out
3. **`AGENTS.md`** — agent behaviour rules, what not to do

For specific work:

- **Strategy work** → `docs/strategies/<strategy>.md` for that strategy
- **Adapter work** (adding/fixing a supplier) → `fba_engine/adapters/<supplier>/` and look at sibling adapters as templates
- **Threshold tuning** → `shared/config/decision_thresholds.yaml` (the single tunable knob is `target_roi`)

## Common operations

### Run the supplier pricelist strategy
```bash
python run.py --supplier connect-beauty
# or with explicit market data
python run.py --supplier abgee --market-data fba_engine/data/pricelists/abgee/raw/keepa_combined.csv
```

### Run all tests
```bash
# Shared library + canonical engine
cd shared/lib/python && pytest tests/ sourcing_engine/tests/ && cd ../../..

# Per-supplier adapter tests (run from supplier folder so relative paths resolve)
for s in abgee connect-beauty shure zappies; do
  cd fba_engine/data/pricelists/$s && pytest ../../../adapters/$s/tests/ && cd ../../../..
done
```

Note: the supplier adapter tests use relative paths like `raw/some_file.pdf`,
so they must be invoked from the supplier's data folder.

### Add a new supplier
1. Create `fba_engine/adapters/<new-supplier>/` (use `_template/` as starting point)
2. Implement `ingest.py` and `normalise.py` for that supplier's file format
3. Create `fba_engine/data/pricelists/<new-supplier>/raw/` and drop in price lists
4. Run `python run.py --supplier <new-supplier>`

### Tune the ROI target
Edit `shared/config/decision_thresholds.yaml`:
```yaml
target_roi: 0.30   # change to taste
```
That's it. All downstream gates derive from this.

## What changed in steps 1-3 (recap)

- **Step 1:** Centralised all thresholds into `shared/config/`. Replaced the
  margin-based SHORTLIST gate with an ROI-based gate (single tunable: `target_roi`).
  Doc drift fixed.

- **Step 2:** Deduplicated the sourcing engine — was 4× copied across
  supplier folders, now one canonical copy at `shared/lib/python/sourcing_engine/`.
  Per-supplier code reduced to just the legitimately-different
  `ingest.py` and `normalise.py` files.

- **Step 3:** Restructured the repo. The two old top-level pipelines
  (`keepa_niche_finder/`, `supplier_pricelist_finder/`) no longer exist as
  separate trees. Engine code is in `shared/`, supplier adapters and data
  are in `fba_engine/`, MCP is in `services/`. Vestigial files removed.
  v5 PRD/BUILD_PROMPT moved to `docs/archive/`.

---

## What's coming in steps 4-6

- **Step 4:** Extract the legacy Keepa phases (currently in `fba_engine/_legacy_keepa/`)
  into composable steps at `fba_engine/steps/` (Python translation of the
  Node.js implementation). After step 4, `_legacy_keepa/` is gone.

- **Step 5:** Express both existing strategies as YAML compositions in
  `fba_engine/strategies/`. A `runner.py` reads a strategy YAML and executes
  its steps. Cowork orchestrates this.

- **Step 6:** Implement Skill 99 (Find Suppliers For Keepa-Discovered ASINs)
  as a new strategy composing existing steps + one new discovery step.
  Future strategies (brand outreach, retail arbitrage) follow the same pattern.
