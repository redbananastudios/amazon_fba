# Amazon FBA Sourcing System

> **Step 3 update (2026-04-28):** Repo restructured. One engine, named
> strategies, ordered steps. The two former pipelines (`keepa_niche_finder/`,
> `supplier_pricelist_finder/`) no longer exist as separate top-level trees.
> See `docs/architecture.md`.

## Current State
**Last updated:** 2026-04-29 (end of session)
**Currently working on:** Nothing in flight. **MCP sourcing-tools expansion (PR #5) is merged into main.**
**Status:** Feature complete and live. Pipeline now auto-annotates matched rows with SP-API data (restrictions, FBA eligibility, live Buy Box, catalog brand, hazmat). Markdown report has a "🚫 Restriction notes" section listing gated SHORTLIST items.

**What was delivered (15 commits merged via PR #5, `f8dfe64`):**
- 7 MCP tools (`check_listing_restrictions`, `check_fba_eligibility`, `estimate_fees_batch`, `get_catalog_item`, `get_live_pricing`, `preflight_asin` composite, plus CLI mode)
- Python pipeline integration (`shared/lib/python/sourcing_engine/pipeline/preflight.py`)
- Persistent disk cache at `<repo>/.cache/fba-mcp/` (gitignored, TTLs configurable per resource via env vars)
- 100 vitest unit + 5 live SP-API integration + 42 pytest tests, all green
- Code reviewed (4 review findings landed in the PR), QA'd end-to-end on real connect-beauty data (3 production bugs found and fixed before merge)

**Tests baseline going forward:**
```bash
cd services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp && npm test                  # 100/100 unit
cd services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp && npm run test:integration  # 5/5 live (requires SP_API creds)
cd shared/lib/python && pytest sourcing_engine/tests/        # 42/42
```

**Possible follow-up tickets** (documented in PR #5 description, not blockers):
- M1 `get-live-pricing.ts` — defensive condition-filter on `BuyBoxPrices[]`
- M2 `check-listing-restrictions.ts` — switch to reasonCode-first BRAND/CATEGORY classification
- M3 `types.ts` — `raw` payloads bloat composite output ~10×; consider `include_raw?: boolean` (default false)
- M4 `get-catalog-item.ts` — hazmat false-positive on string values like "none"
- L1-L7 — minor CLI consistency, type fix-ups

**Next steps:** None pending. User can pick from the M-series follow-ups or move to other work (e.g., reorganisation step 4: extract Keepa phases from `_legacy_keepa/`).

**Blockers:** None.

### Workflow notes (cumulative across sessions)
- **Worktree gotcha:** `[[ -d .git ]]` checks fail in worktrees because `.git` is a file pointer. Use `[[ -e .git ]]`.
- **TS imports:** This project uses ESM/nodenext — relative imports MUST end in `.js` even when source is `.ts` (e.g., `import {X} from "./foo.js"`). Otherwise `npm run build` fails (vitest is more lenient).
- **MCP test path:** Always run `npm` commands inside the actual worktree's `services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/`, not `O:/fba/services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/`. They're separate copies.
- **Credential sync:** After editing `F:\My Drive\workspace\credentials.env`, run `& 'F:\My Drive\workspace\sync-credentials.ps1'` (PowerShell — bash quoting breaks on the space in "My Drive"). Then verify with `grep '"SP_API_' "C:/Users/peter/.claude/settings.json"`.
- **MCP `.mcp.json` path** at repo root references the MCP at `services/amazon-fba-fees-mcp/dist/index.js` (corrected from old root-level path during cleanup).
- **SP-API endpoint group names** (amazon-sp-api lib): catalogItems, productFees, listingsRestrictions, fbaInboundEligibility, productPricing. Use `client.callAPI({ operation, endpoint, ... })`.
- **Disk cache layout:** `<repo>/.cache/fba-mcp/<resource>/<key-parts>__joined.json` — gitignored. `DiskCache.get()` returns `{ hit, stale, data }` enabling stale-on-error fallback.
- **Vitest integration tests:** Live in `src/__integration__/*.integration.test.ts`. Excluded from default `npm test` via `vitest.config.ts` exclude. Run with `npm run test:integration` (separate `vitest.integration.config.ts`).

## Session Protocol
- At the end of each session, update the "Current State" section above
- If you learned something about how this project works that would help next time, add it to this file
- Commit CLAUDE.md changes as part of your work

## Read these first

For any work in this repo, read in this order:

1. **`docs/SPEC.md`** — business logic, decision rules, the truth (supersedes the v5 PRD)
2. **`docs/architecture.md`** — how the system is laid out
3. **`AGENTS.md`** — agent behaviour rules, what not to do

For specific work:

- **Strategy work** → `docs/strategies/<strategy>.md` for that strategy
- **Adapter work** (adding/fixing a supplier) → `fba_engine/adapters/<supplier>/` and look at sibling adapters as templates
- **Threshold tuning** → `shared/config/decision_thresholds.yaml` (the single tunable knob is `target_roi`)

## Common operations

### Run the supplier pricelist strategy
```bash
python run.py --supplier connect-beauty
# or with explicit market data
python run.py --supplier abgee --market-data fba_engine/data/pricelists/abgee/raw/keepa_combined.csv
```

### Run all tests
```bash
# Shared library + canonical engine
cd shared/lib/python && pytest tests/ sourcing_engine/tests/ && cd ../../..

# Per-supplier adapter tests (run from supplier folder so relative paths resolve)
for s in abgee connect-beauty shure zappies; do
  cd fba_engine/data/pricelists/$s && pytest ../../../adapters/$s/tests/ && cd ../../../..
done
```

Note: the supplier adapter tests use relative paths like `raw/some_file.pdf`,
so they must be invoked from the supplier's data folder.

### Add a new supplier
1. Create `fba_engine/adapters/<new-supplier>/` (use `_template/` as starting point)
2. Implement `ingest.py` and `normalise.py` for that supplier's file format
3. Create `fba_engine/data/pricelists/<new-supplier>/raw/` and drop in price lists
4. Run `python run.py --supplier <new-supplier>`

### Tune the ROI target
Edit `shared/config/decision_thresholds.yaml`:
```yaml
target_roi: 0.30   # change to taste
```
That's it. All downstream gates derive from this.

## What changed in steps 1-3 (recap)

- **Step 1:** Centralised all thresholds into `shared/config/`. Replaced the
  margin-based SHORTLIST gate with an ROI-based gate (single tunable: `target_roi`).
  Doc drift fixed.

- **Step 2:** Deduplicated the sourcing engine — was 4× copied across
  supplier folders, now one canonical copy at `shared/lib/python/sourcing_engine/`.
  Per-supplier code reduced to just the legitimately-different
  `ingest.py` and `normalise.py` files.

- **Step 3:** Restructured the repo. The two old top-level pipelines
  (`keepa_niche_finder/`, `supplier_pricelist_finder/`) no longer exist as
  separate trees. Engine code is in `shared/`, supplier adapters and data
  are in `fba_engine/`, MCP is in `services/`. Vestigial files removed.
  v5 PRD/BUILD_PROMPT moved to `docs/archive/`.

---

## What's coming in steps 4-6

- **Step 4:** Extract the legacy Keepa phases (currently in `fba_engine/_legacy_keepa/`)
  into composable steps at `fba_engine/steps/` (Python translation of the
  Node.js implementation). After step 4, `_legacy_keepa/` is gone.

- **Step 5:** Express both existing strategies as YAML compositions in
  `fba_engine/strategies/`. A `runner.py` reads a strategy YAML and executes
  its steps. Cowork orchestrates this.

- **Step 6:** Implement Skill 99 (Find Suppliers For Keepa-Discovered ASINs)
  as a new strategy composing existing steps + one new discovery step.
  Future strategies (brand outreach, retail arbitrage) follow the same pattern.
